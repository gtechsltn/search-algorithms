## Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted collection. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

### Implementation

The Binary Search algorithm is implemented in the `BinarySearchAlgorithm` class. The method signature is as follows:

```csharp
public static int Search(int[] array, int target)
```

## Linear Search

Linear Search is a simple algorithm for finding an element in a collection. It works by iterating over each element in the collection and comparing it to the target.

### Implementation

The Linear Search algorithm is implemented in the `LinearSearchAlgorithm` class. The method signature is as follows:

```csharp
public static int Search(int[] array, int target)
```

## Benchmarking

Benchmarking is the process of measuring the performance of an algorithm. This project uses the [BenchmarkDotNet]

## Usage

To run the benchmark, execute the following command:

```bash
dotnet run -c Release
```
